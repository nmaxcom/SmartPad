| T-2026-02-13-02 | project | Replace every docs-site placeholder with real runnable examples from specs | Assistant | in_progress | p1 | 2026-02-15 | For each generated feature guide in `website/docs/specs/`, ensure at least one runnable happy-path snippet and one edge/guardrail snippet are surfaced via `ExamplePlayground`, then regenerate with `npm run docs:docusaurus:publish-local` and verify page renders via Playwright against `/docs/.../index.html` |
| T-2026-02-13-03 | maintenance | Add PR template checks for spec/docs/test sync | Assistant | todo | p1 | 2026-02-15 | Add checklist fields to pull request template |
| T-2026-02-13-04 | project | Decide docs engine and architecture (Docusaurus vs static) | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-14 | Decision memo added with static-now path and Docusaurus migration trigger |
| T-2026-02-13-05 | project | Implement generated docs pipeline for web output | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-15 | Added `npm run docs:web:build` to generate `public/docs/index.html` |
| T-2026-02-13-06 | project | Fix docs-link behavior in local dev and production parity | Assistant | done | p1 | 2026-02-14 | Header now uses normalized base-path URL to `docs/index.html` with unit coverage |
| T-2026-02-14-01 | project | Ship professional docs UI baseline (desktop + mobile) without manual bug triage | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-16 | Replaced docs visual system with branded gradients/cards, upgraded link palette, expanded sidebar journeys, and validated `/docs` pages with Playwright on live `npm run dev` |
| T-2026-02-14-02 | project | Rebuild docs IA into clear user journeys (Start, Syntax, Features, Troubleshooting) | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-16 | Delivered ordered feature guides + grouped sidebars + cleaned titles/summaries generated from specs |
| T-2026-02-14-03 | project | Add docs release quality gate so UI/UX regressions are caught before merge | Assistant | todo | p1 | 2026-02-16 | Enforce checks for broken links, mobile layout sanity, accessibility basics, and docs build success in CI + local workflow |
| T-2026-02-14-04 | project | Migrate docs delivery from hand-styled static page to Docusaurus | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-15 | Implemented `website/` Docusaurus app + spec generator + build sync to `public/docs/`; docs button target now resolves Docusaurus output |
| T-2026-02-14-05 | project | Complete docs content backfill so every public page has practical examples | Assistant | in_progress | p0 | 2026-02-16 | Expand each spec guide with scenario-led examples that include expected results and “when to use” notes; done when all feature pages have at least one runnable happy path plus one guardrail scenario rendered in the docs UI and validated by Playwright |
| T-2026-02-14-06 | project | Add syntax-aware color highlighting for docs examples so examples are easier to scan | Assistant | done | p1 | 2026-02-16 | Added Prism `smartpad` language + themed token styles and regenerated docs so variables/operators/units/warnings are visually distinct |
| T-2026-02-14-07 | project | Rewrite docs explanations into clear user-first guidance instead of spec-style wording | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-16 | Rebuilt generated docs pages around product-style sections (“what you can ship,” live playground, blueprint/design notes, pitfalls, deep reference) and removed folded raw spec dumps from reading flow |
| T-2026-02-14-09 | project | Deliver phase-2 premium docs experience (animated hero, use-case narratives, and guided mini-labs) | Assistant | in_progress | p0 | 2026-02-17 | Inline interactive SmartPad embeds are now live in docs examples with forced Spatial+Neon embed mode; next add animated hero sequences, path-based narrative pages, and guided mini-lab flows, then verify with Playwright screenshot sweep |
| T-2026-02-14-10 | project | Remove double-vertical-scroll behavior from embedded docs playground frames | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-15 | Embed mode now enforces hidden document/card overflow with one editor-content scroll surface and iframe `scrolling=\"no\"`; Playwright DOM checks confirm no extra iframe/document scrollbar surfaces on docs previews |
| T-2026-02-14-11 | project | Surface blocked live-result state directly inside SmartPad preview chips (no docs-side status chrome) | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-15 | Replaced docs status-pill approach with native editor blocked-live chip that shows the reason inline in the result lane; Playwright verified blocked state visibility in embed preview runtime |
| T-2026-02-14-12 | project | Prevent docs browsing from creating or mutating persistent SmartPad sheets | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-15 | Iframe previews now use `sp_preview` ephemeral embed mode (no sheet import, no persistent DB writes), while `Open in SmartPad` uses explicit `sp_import=1`; Playwright verified sheet titles/count unchanged before vs after docs browsing |
| T-2026-02-14-06 | feature | Restore result-click plotting while preserving click-to-insert-reference behavior behind explicit mode/gesture separation | Assistant | todo | p0 | 2026-02-17 | Deliver a conflict-safe interaction model where default result click inserts references and plotting is available via explicit alternate gesture/control, with updated editor UX hints; add unit tests for interaction routing and e2e coverage for both flows; done when users can reliably perform both actions in the same session without accidental cross-triggering |
| T-2026-02-14-07 | maintenance | Emit specific broken-reference cause codes (`source_error`, `missing_source`, `type_mismatch`) and surface actionable UI messaging | Assistant | todo | p1 | 2026-02-18 | Add structured cause-code propagation from evaluator/reference graph to chip rendering, map each cause to clear user-facing copy, and add regression tests covering each code path; done when each failure scenario renders the correct code/message and tests pass |
| T-2026-02-14-08 | maintenance | Add keyboard-accessible result-chip workflow (focus, insert, jump-to-source) with ARIA-complete semantics | Assistant | todo | p1 | 2026-02-19 | Implement tab/focus order, keyboard insertion and source-jump commands, ARIA labels/roles, and visible focus styles for chips; verify with targeted unit tests plus Playwright keyboard e2e scenarios; done when full chip workflow is operable without pointer input |
