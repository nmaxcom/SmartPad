| T-2026-02-14-12 | project | Prevent docs browsing from creating or mutating persistent SmartPad sheets | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-15 | Iframe previews now use `sp_preview` ephemeral embed mode (no sheet import, no persistent DB writes), while `Open in SmartPad` uses explicit `sp_import=1`; Playwright verified sheet titles/count unchanged before vs after docs browsing |
| T-2026-02-14-06 | feature | Restore result-click plotting while preserving click-to-insert-reference behavior behind explicit mode/gesture separation | Assistant | todo | p0 | 2026-02-17 | Deliver a conflict-safe interaction model where default result click inserts references and plotting is available via explicit alternate gesture/control, with updated editor UX hints; add unit tests for interaction routing and e2e coverage for both flows; done when users can reliably perform both actions in the same session without accidental cross-triggering |

| T-2026-02-20-02 | project | Establish trusted implemented-vs-proposed spec split with CI-enforced traceability | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-20 | Added `docs/spec-trust.json`, canonical folders (`docs/Specs/implemented`, `docs/Specs/proposed`), per-feature trust cards, `npm run spec:trust` gate (`scripts/spec-trust-check.js`), and integrated it into `verify:changed`; updated AI manuals/operations/reliability docs so future sessions maintain 1:1 spec-to-implementation trust |
| T-2026-02-20-03 | project | Fix online webdocs availability and correctness so the hosted docs path resolves and renders expected docs content | Assistant | done | p1 | 2026-02-22 | Fixed GitHub Pages deployment to always run `docs:docusaurus:publish-prod` before app build, removed hardcoded `/docs/...` links that produced `/SmartPad/docs/docs/...` at runtime, and validated with `npm run docs:docusaurus:publish-prod`, `npm run build`, and `npm run verify:changed`; generated `public/docs` now targets `/SmartPad/docs/` assets/links |
| T-2026-02-20-04 | project | Add computer-related units to the canonical units registry and keep syntax/unit docs aligned | Assistant | done | p1 | 2026-02-22 | Added information + throughput units in runtime registry (`src/units/definitions.ts`) including bit/byte, decimal+binary size units, and rate units (`Mbit/s`, `MB/s`, alias forms like `Mbps`); aligned syntax registry/docs/spec map, and verified with targeted unit suites (`units.test.ts`, `unitAliasExamples.test.ts`, `unitsnetIntegrationPlan.test.ts`, `definitions.test.ts`) |
| T-2026-02-20-05 | project | Show all supported units in webdocs from a single source-of-truth so docs never omit categories | Assistant | done | p1 | 2026-02-22 | Docs generator now derives unit families from `SUPPORTED_UNITS` and currency symbols from `CURRENCY_INFO`, renders units/rates/currency sections into syntax playbook, and publishes synced output to `website/docs` + `public/docs`; verified via `npm run docs:docusaurus:publish-local`, content spot checks, and full reliability gates (`docs:map`, `docs:drift`, `spec:test`, `spec:trust`, `verify:changed`) |
| T-2026-02-23-21 | maintenance | Support implicit multiplication between numeric/grouped operands so `2(3+4)` and `(2+3)(4+5)` evaluate to `14` and `45` instead of parse errors | Assistant | todo | p1 | 2026-02-26 | Update expression parser to insert/handle implicit `*` for adjacency patterns `number(`, `)(`, `)number`; add unit tests for both reported inputs and at least 3 adjacency variants; verify with `CI=1 npx jest tests/unit/mathEvaluator.test.ts tests/unit/astParser.test.ts --runInBand --watchman=false` plus `node scripts/run-temporary-edge-tests.js` expecting cases 3 and 4 to pass |
| T-2026-02-23-22 | maintenance | Normalize bare function-call UX for comma-separated helper forms so `max 3,7=>` returns `7` (or emits a targeted syntax correction) instead of list/unit mismatch | Assistant | todo | p1 | 2026-02-26 | Define parser rule for no-parentheses helper calls (`max/min/abs/round` scope) or a deterministic rewrite to canonical call syntax; add regression tests for `max 3,7=>` and sibling forms; verify with `CI=1 npx jest tests/unit/functions.test.ts tests/unit/expressionComponents.test.ts --runInBand --watchman=false` and temporary case 9 passing |
| T-2026-02-23-23 | maintenance | Make compact rate-duration arithmetic parse reliably so `9L/min*18min=>` returns `162 L` without requiring extra spacing | Assistant | todo | p0 | 2026-02-25 | Refine UnitsNet tokenization/boundary handling so compound unit strings stop at real arithmetic operators while preserving valid units like `m/s^2`; add regression tests for compact and spaced equivalents; verify via `CI=1 npx jest tests/unit/unitsnetEvaluator.test.ts tests/unit/unitsnetIntegration.test.ts --runInBand --watchman=false` and temporary case 23 passing |
| T-2026-02-23-24 | maintenance | Route time-literal ranges to temporal range evaluator so `09:00..11:00 step 30 min=>` returns time sequence instead of integer-range validation error | Assistant | todo | p0 | 2026-02-25 | Adjust range routing/type detection to treat `HH:MM` endpoints as time-range candidates before numeric range validation; add targeted tests for time range happy/guardrail cases; verify with `CI=1 npx jest tests/unit/range.test.ts tests/unit/dateRange.test.ts tests/unit/localeDate.test.ts --runInBand --watchman=false` and temporary case 40 passing |
| T-2026-02-23-25 | maintenance | Resolve variable-vs-unit symbol ambiguity for deferred expressions so `x = 2*y`, `y=3`, `x=>` returns `6` instead of `2 years` | Assistant | todo | p0 | 2026-02-25 | Ensure unresolved identifiers in assignment formulas preserve variable intent and rebind after dependency definition before unit-symbol fallback; add regression tests for the exact typing order and mixed variable/unit symbol collisions; verify with `CI=1 npx jest tests/unit/combinedAssignmentEvaluatorV2.test.ts tests/unit/integration-fixes.test.ts --runInBand --watchman=false` and temporary case 45 passing |
| T-2026-02-23-26 | maintenance | Accept locale slash date input in default user flows so `06/05/2024=>` parses to a date under configured/system locale instead of unsupported-format error | Assistant | todo | p1 | 2026-02-27 | Implement locale-aware slash-date parsing policy (with deterministic fallback and clear ambiguity rules), update date specs/docs accordingly, and add tests for US + non-US locale scenarios; verify with `CI=1 npx jest tests/unit/localeDate.test.ts tests/unit/dateMathEvaluator.test.ts --runInBand --watchman=false` and temporary case 49 passing |
| T-2026-02-23-27 | maintenance | Parse thousands separators as scalar numbers in assignments so `b=2,000=>` stores/displays `2000` instead of list-like `2, 0` split | Assistant | todo | p0 | 2026-02-25 | Fix numeric tokenizer/grouping normalization for comma-grouped literals in assignment/evaluation paths; add regression tests for valid and invalid grouping patterns; verify with `CI=1 npx jest tests/unit/thousandGroupingFormatting.test.ts tests/unit/listSpecExamples.test.ts --runInBand --watchman=false` and temporary case 50 passing |
| T-2026-02-23-28 | maintenance | Convert temporary exploratory edge suite into triage-ready regression workflow with stable pass/fail tracking for discovered parser UX defects | Assistant | todo | p1 | 2026-02-27 | Keep `scripts/run-temporary-edge-tests.js` as a repeatable triage tool, tag each failing case with linked TODO id, and add a lightweight summary command/report section in reliability docs; verify by rerunning suite and confirming TODO-linked metadata appears for all failing cases |
