| T-2026-02-20-02 | project | Establish trusted implemented-vs-proposed spec split with CI-enforced traceability | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-20 | Added `docs/spec-trust.json`, canonical folders (`docs/Specs/implemented`, `docs/Specs/proposed`), per-feature trust cards, `npm run spec:trust` gate (`scripts/spec-trust-check.js`), and integrated it into `verify:changed`; updated AI manuals/operations/reliability docs so future sessions maintain 1:1 spec-to-implementation trust |
| T-2026-02-20-03 | project | Fix online webdocs availability and correctness so the hosted docs path resolves and renders expected docs content | Assistant | done | p1 | 2026-02-22 | Fixed GitHub Pages deployment to always run `docs:docusaurus:publish-prod` before app build, removed hardcoded `/docs/...` links that produced `/SmartPad/docs/docs/...` at runtime, and validated with `npm run docs:docusaurus:publish-prod`, `npm run build`, and `npm run verify:changed`; generated `public/docs` now targets `/SmartPad/docs/` assets/links |
| T-2026-02-20-04 | project | Add computer-related units to the canonical units registry and keep syntax/unit docs aligned | Assistant | done | p1 | 2026-02-22 | Added information + throughput units in runtime registry (`src/units/definitions.ts`) including bit/byte, decimal+binary size units, and rate units (`Mbit/s`, `MB/s`, alias forms like `Mbps`); aligned syntax registry/docs/spec map, and verified with targeted unit suites (`units.test.ts`, `unitAliasExamples.test.ts`, `unitsnetIntegrationPlan.test.ts`, `definitions.test.ts`) |
| T-2026-02-20-05 | project | Show all supported units in webdocs from a single source-of-truth so docs never omit categories | Assistant | done | p1 | 2026-02-22 | Docs generator now derives unit families from `SUPPORTED_UNITS` and currency symbols from `CURRENCY_INFO`, renders units/rates/currency sections into syntax playbook, and publishes synced output to `website/docs` + `public/docs`; verified via `npm run docs:docusaurus:publish-local`, content spot checks, and full reliability gates (`docs:map`, `docs:drift`, `spec:test`, `spec:trust`, `verify:changed`) |
| T-2026-02-23-21 | maintenance | Implement implicit multiplication adjacency support (`number(` and `)(`) so `2(3+4)` and `(2+3)(4+5)` evaluate correctly without breaking existing parse paths | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-27 | Completed: parser now injects implicit `*` for `number(` and `)(`; added high-coverage regression suite (`tests/unit/implicitMultiplicationAndCompactRate.test.ts`), updated live-result template/e2e coverage, and reran broad targeted unit suites plus temporary edge script (cases 3 and 4 now pass) |
| T-2026-02-23-23 | maintenance | Make compact rate-duration arithmetic parse reliably so `9L/min*18min=>` returns `162 L` without requiring extra spacing | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-25 | Completed: UnitsNet tokenizer now stops compound-unit scan at arithmetic operators before numeric terms, preserving valid units (`m/s^2`, `N*m`) while fixing compact forms; added unit+e2e regressions and verified temporary edge case 23 passes (`node scripts/run-temporary-edge-tests.js`) |
| T-2026-02-23-24 | maintenance | Route time-literal ranges to temporal range evaluator so `09:00..11:00 step 30 min=>` returns time sequence instead of integer-range validation error | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-25 | Completed: range literal evaluation now accepts `time` endpoints and emits time-slot lists (including descending sequences) with hour/minute/second duration-step guardrails; covered with new unit tests in `tests/unit/dateRange.test.ts` and verified by temporary edge case 40 passing (`node scripts/run-temporary-edge-tests.js`). |
| T-2026-02-23-25 | maintenance | Resolve variable-vs-unit symbol ambiguity for deferred expressions so `x = 2*y`, `y=3`, `x=>` returns `6` instead of `2 years` | Assistant | done | p0 | 2026-02-25 | Completed: assignment formula parsing now disables implicit unit-symbol fallback when unresolved identifiers are present and no UnitsNet signature is detected, preserving variable intent; added regression coverage in `tests/unit/variableUnitAmbiguity.test.ts` and confirmed temporary edge case 45 passes. |
| T-2026-02-23-26 | project | Clarify and enforce locale-dependent slash-date policy so behavior is predictable across locales (e.g. `es-ES` vs `en-US`) | Assistant | done | p1 | 2026-02-27 | Completed: locale date rewrite now applies locale-order normalization when `dateLocale` is set and defers to runtime locale parsing when unset (no hard fail); updated locale/date specs and tests (`tests/unit/localeDate.test.ts`, `tests/unit/dateMathEvaluator.test.ts`) and verified temporary edge case 49 passes. |
| T-2026-02-23-27 | maintenance | Keep comma-grouped numeric input unsupported but return explicit validation errors instead of ambiguous outputs like `2, 0` | Assistant | done | p1 | 2026-02-26 | Completed: grouped numeric assignment input (`1,250`, `$1,250`, `b=2,000=>`) now fails fast with explicit validation copy via shared grouped-number validator; updated list/spec docs and regression tests (`tests/unit/thousandGroupingFormatting.test.ts`, `tests/unit/listSpecExamples.test.ts`) and verified temporary edge case 50 passes. |
| T-2026-02-23-28 | maintenance | Convert temporary exploratory edge suite into triage-ready regression workflow with stable pass/fail tracking for discovered parser UX defects | Assistant | done | p1 | 2026-02-27 | Completed: `scripts/run-temporary-edge-tests.js` now supports expected-error cases, includes per-case TODO linkage in report rows/failure details, and `aidocs/AI_RELIABILITY_SYSTEM.md` now documents this triage flow (`npm run test:temporary-edge`); rerun shows 50/50 pass with TODO metadata preserved. |
| T-2026-02-24-01 | maintenance | Triage and disposition syntax bug-hunt findings (`BH-001`..`BH-012`) so each has an explicit fix/spec/feature decision and owner | Assistant | todo | p0 | 2026-02-26 | Convert findings from `artifacts/bug-hunt-brief-2026-02-24T01-08-02Z.md` into tracked implementation/spec tasks with owner + target release, implement the top three `P0/P1` fixes with regression tests, rerun `node scripts/run-temporary-edge-tests.js` plus targeted unit suites for touched modules, and close this item only when every high-priority finding has a linked code fix or an approved product/spec decision. |
