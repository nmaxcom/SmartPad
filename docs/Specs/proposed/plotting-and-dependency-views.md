# Plotting and Dependency Views

- Status: `proposed`
- Source spec: `docs/Specs/Plotting.spec.md`
- Mapped group: `Plotting And Visualization`
- Reason: this area is not yet trust-gated by dedicated plotting-focused tests in the spec-trust registry.

Promotion criteria to `implemented`:
1. Add dedicated plotting coverage (unit and/or e2e) tied to source-spec claims.
2. Update `docs/spec-trust.json` status to `implemented` with concrete `testRefs`.
3. Move this card to `docs/Specs/implemented/`.
4. Run `npm run spec:trust` and `npm run verify:changed`.
