# UX / Feature Ideas Backlog (Legacy Notes Delta)

Status: proposed
Source: extracted from legacy `docs/notes.md`.

This page captures feature ideas that are not current shipped contracts.

## Candidate features

- Goal-seeking interaction from result chips:
  - "make this result X by changing Y" flow.
- Inline variable autocomplete/prediction while typing.
- Scenario comparison layouts (side-by-side what-if views).
- Better equation/unit readability affordances on hover.
- Rich-document additions (images, links, formatting).
- Unified semantics/UX for keyword operators (`as`, `in`, `to`, `per`, etc.).
- Reverse percentage queries:
  - `5% of what is 6 EUR`
  - `5% on what is 6 EUR`
  - `5% off what is 6 EUR`
- Interactive controls syntax experiments (inline sliders and controls panel).
- Automatic graph suggestions for list/function outputs.
- Time/playhead animation for expressions using a time variable.

## Legacy bug notes preserved for triage

- Thousands-separator parsing inconsistencies in assignment input.

Promotion path:
- Move accepted ideas into dedicated proposed/implemented feature specs with tests.
