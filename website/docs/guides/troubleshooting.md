# Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

## If conversions fail

- Verify the target unit/currency is valid.
- Prefer `value in TARGET` over free-form arrows.
- Check manual FX overrides before blaming live rates.

## If results look wrong

- Break formulas into named steps.
- Confirm list/range boundaries and step size.
- Inspect locale-sensitive dates and decimal separators.

## If behavior differs from expectation

Use the per-feature guide and then open the canonical spec for authoritative rules.
