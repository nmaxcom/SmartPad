Hello! You've arrived at the central repository for the SmartPad project, a text-based web application that combines the simplicity of a plain text editor with the power of real-time mathematical interpretation.

## 🗺️ How This Repository is Organized

This repository is a complete, self-contained ecosystem for building the SmartPad application. We take documentation and process very seriously to ensure a smooth and consistent development experience, especially when collaborating with AI assistants.

The root directory is intentionally kept clean. All the detailed project documentation—from the high-level vision to architectural blueprints and developer guides—lives inside the `docs/` directory.

## To Understand the Project

If you want to learn about what SmartPad is, its features, and its goals, your journey starts here:
